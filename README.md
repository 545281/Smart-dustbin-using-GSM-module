# Smart-dustbin-using-GSM-module
The Smart Dustbin using GSM is an IoT-based system that detects waste levels, segregates wet and dry waste, opens the lid automatically, and sends SMS alerts when full. It promotes hygiene, efficient waste management, and supports smart city initiatives like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
